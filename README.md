# DaVinciVision ðŸŽ¨
Project for DSCI-471 where the aim is to build CNN prediction models which predict which artist created an artwork. 

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time

| This dataset consists of three files. It is 2.32 GB in size which seems promising to train a quality DL model. There are a total of 8446 images (artworks) and 50 artists (classes). 

* artists.csv: A dataset containing information for each artist.
* images.zip: A collection of full-sized images, divided into folders and sequentially numbered.
* resized.zip: A resized version of the image collection, extracted from the folder structure for faster processing.

## Models
### CNN Models 
* AlexNet
* VGG Network(s)
* NiN
* Inception Network(s)
* ResNet & ResNeXt
* DenseNet
